  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>

    <li>
      <strong>Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) Systems at TWiST Lab</strong><br>
      Actively contributed to the design and implementation of an O-RAN–compliant radio access network, focusing on modularity, flexibility, and interoperability across disaggregated RAN components.
      Worked with open interfaces and software-defined radio (SDR) platforms, and evaluated system performance under realistic wireless conditions to support next-generation (6G-ready) network architectures.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Space–Ground Integrated Communication Systems</strong><br>
      Implemented communication protocols for space–ground integrated systems, addressing challenges related to heterogeneous link characteristics, latency, and reliability across satellite and terrestrial networks.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Machine Learning for Real-Time Image Enhancement</strong><br>
      Developed and implemented machine learning algorithms for image enhancement and green-screen removal, optimizing pipelines for real-time processing and low-latency inference.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>IoT-Based Intrusion Detection System (IDS)</strong><br>
      Led the development of an intrusion detection system for smart homes using Raspberry Pi and IoT sensors, enabling real-time monitoring and detection of unauthorized activities through edge-based processing.
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Image Processing for Crack Localization</strong><br>
      Developed an image processing pipeline using edge detection and texture analysis techniques to achieve accurate crack localization for structural inspection applications.
    </li>

  </ul>
